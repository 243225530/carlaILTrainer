Carla Imitation Learning Trainer


The main project belongs to Carla Team, and I just wrote a training system for the main project. [Here](https://github.com/carla-simulator/imitation-learning) you can find more information about the original project.


Please check out [issue](https://github.com/carla-simulator/imitation-learning/issues/1) to find out why this code was published. 


TODO:
* Run all branches , but just back propagate on one ( use a mask for that).
* Use the Tensorflow queues for data loading
* Compatibility fix for carla checkpoint loading 
* Fix the loss function (Use only one loss)
* Balance the dataset according to labels in training mode
* Test the whole system with the recent benchmark
